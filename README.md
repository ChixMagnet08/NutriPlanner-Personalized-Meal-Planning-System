## OOP Principles
The project incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity, reusability, and clear structure.

1. **Encapsulation**  
   - Hides internal data and provides controlled access through getters and setters (e.g., `User` class and `UserValidator` methods).  

2. **Inheritance**  
   - Promotes code reuse; `Donor` inherits from `User` to access its properties and methods.  

3. **Polymorphism**  
   - Allows different classes to define unique implementations of a method (e.g., `DonationType` with abstract `confirmAndProcessDonation` method).  

4. **Abstraction**  
   - Hides unnecessary details; `User` class provides abstracted methods like `getName()` and `verifyPin()` for interacting with user data.
